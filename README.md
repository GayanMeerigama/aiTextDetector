## Introduction

This repository contains a project to 1) develop an application that will 
use a large language model to automatically write text and 2) an 
application that identifies AI-generated written text. 

The goal of this project is to develop a basic filter model as part of a larger NLP pipeline for the automated scoring of student essays.

## Folder structure

- asapData: contains all of the code and data we will develop relevant to using the ASAP data.

- templates/autoScore: contains highly-performing and highly-rated example templates designed for automated *scoring* of the ASAP student response data. 

- templates/aiDetect: contains example code from other projects used to identify machine-generated text using a different dataset.
