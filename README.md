## Introduction

This repository contains a project to 1) develop an application that will 
use a large language model to automatically write text and 2) an 
application that identifies AI-generated written text. 

The goal of this project is to develop a basic filter model as part of a larger NLP pipeline for the automated scoring of student essays.
